# AR player for three.js


# Demo of the example apps
- Describe a process to follow
  - Similar to industrial steps but funnier
  - e.g. a recipe in the kitchen
- How to leave the office
- Limit shaking by not using rotation. only position/scale
- Idea of scenario "guided tour of the dublin office"
  - then i send that to california
  - photosphere
  - ar info

# Video of the apps
- put marker all over the appartements
- the marker near the microwave
  - popup the microwave scene
  - display intro
  - then menu : info/how to cook eggs/how to cook pasta/
- interactive + contextual + spatialized
- cool sounds when it pops up

# TODO
- print multiple markers
- glue them on "Liege". easy to cut
- stick them on walls with patafix
- attach a story to each
