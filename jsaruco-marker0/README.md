# How To Design The Example

-

---

# TODO
- the goal is what ? to produce examples of AR with markers
- ultimatly it is a phone webapps
  - support gradual degradation
  - with dual screen or not ?
  - with gyro controls or not ?
  - with environment camera or only face ?
- we use jsaruco to implement it, but it should be almost not important
  - the important is the feature
  - the feature is to be able to recognize and position the marker
  - it is made on a live video stream from getUserMedia
- stuff to debug
- stuff to look shiny


# Ideal App
- full screen video
- marker reconized
- 3d scene appearing on top
  - which 3d scene ?
- could be a nice cooked library
